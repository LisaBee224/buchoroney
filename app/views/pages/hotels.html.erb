<p>The hotel is located at The Point, which, (aside from being a <a href="#" id="point"><%=image_tag "point.png", :class=>"point-img"%>true gem of an album and movie</a> boasting a soundtrack by Harry Nilsson and narration by Ringo Starr), is a center home to cafes, bars, restaurants, and shopping.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a few Airbnb's nearby that would be great options for groups, like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3673266?checkin=06%2F16%2F2017&checkout=06%2F18%2F2017&guests=9&adults=9&children=0&infants=0&s=caWW8uiG" target="_blank">this one in Ayer</a>, or <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10310425?checkin=06%2F16%2F2017&checkout=06%2F18%2F2017&guests=9&adults=9&children=0&infants=0&s=caWW8uiG" target="_blank">this one</a> in Harvard.</p>

<p>As an alternative, <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/massachusetts/hampton-inn-and-suites-westford-chelmsford-BOSWFHX/index.html" target="_blank">The Hampton Inn & Suites Westford-Chelmsford</a> is close by, although, we do not have a block of rooms there.</p>
